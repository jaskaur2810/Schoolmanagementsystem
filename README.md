# School Management System 🏫

This is a Java-based School Management System developed using **Java Swing** for the GUI and **MySQL** for the backend database. It allows management of students, teachers, and courses with a user-friendly interface.

## 📌 Overview

This School Management System provides a basic structure to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on students, teachers, and course data. It’s built for learning purposes, ideal for Java beginners looking to understand GUI development and database integration.

You can:

- Add, update, or delete student records
- Manage teacher and course data
- Connect to a MySQL database for data storage
- Explore Java Swing layouts and event handling

The application is structured using object-oriented principles and is a great example of how Java can be used to build real-world management systems.
